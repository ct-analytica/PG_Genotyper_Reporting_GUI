# Reporting-GUI-Project

This program is intended to simplify our reporting of data gained from genotyper sequencing. 
Our workflow, at its basic levels consist of the following steps
  -AlleleTyper Import
  -Diplotype Calculator Results
  -File Conversion for Genxys, Ovation, etc.
  -Upload to said websites
Instead of using multiple workbooks and websites, the functionality of this program will be a "one-stop-shop" for all of these data processing procedures.
